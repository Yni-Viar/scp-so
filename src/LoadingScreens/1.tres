Name = "SCP-079"
Description = "SCP-079 is an old microcomputer built in 1978. 
It is not known when SCP-079 gained sentience, but it is known that the software has evolved to a point that its hardware should not be able to handle it, even in the realm of fantasy.
It has passed the Turing test, and is quite conversational, though very rude and hateful in tone. It also displays a malevolent desire to escape."
