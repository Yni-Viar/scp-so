Name = "SCP-106"
Description = "SCP-106 appears to be an elderly humanoid, with a general appearance of advanced decomposition. This appearance may vary, but the \"rotting\" quality is observed in all forms.
SCP-106 causes a \"corrosion\" effect in all solid matter it touches, engaging a physical breakdown in materials several seconds after contact. This is observed as rusting, rotting, and cracking of materials, and the creation of a black, mucus-like substance similar to the material coating SCP-106.
SCP-106 can pass through solid matter and will capture and kill its prey by pulling it into what is assumed to be its personal \"pocket dimension\"."
