Name = "SCP-131"
Description = "SCP-131-A and SCP-131-B (affectionately nicknamed the \"Eye Pods\" by personnel) are a pair of teardrop-shaped creatures roughly 30Â cm (1 ft) in height, with a single blue eye in the middle of their bodies.
The subjects seem to respond well to any affection given to them and will quickly bond to the giver of said affection, much in the same way a puppy bonds with a human being. They will follow anyone or anything they've made a bond with anywhere, even into normally restricted areas.
Although curious, the subjects can sense danger in their general vicinity, and if the object of their bond begins to approach something they register as dangerous (e.g., Euclid or Keter class objects) they will swarm around their bonded companion's feet (or appropriate extremities) while babbling in a panicked tone, as if to warn them."
