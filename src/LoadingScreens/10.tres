Name = "SCP-650"
Description = "SCP-650 is a black statue of a stylized humanoid 167cm tall. The statue does not possess hands or facial features: the limbs taper off into rounded points and the head is a smooth surface all around.
If the statue is not being observed, it will relocate itself to a point immediately behind whomever is in the containment site and assume a threatening posture.No noise is made during this relocation process, so the precise method of locomotion is as of yet unknown."
