# SCP: Site Online

## âš  The project is deprecated.
> The project is stuck due to C# usage.
> C# is good for games, that won't have modification support, and I originally wanted that feature to be in the game, since Godot supports modding.
> [TGPY](https://github.com/Yni-Viar/scp-outrun) is the spiritual successor to SCP: Site Online.
